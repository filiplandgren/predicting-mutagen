Feature extraction for mutagen identification

Mutagens are chemical agents that can cause mutations. Mutations are changes in the DNA of a cell, and they can lead to cancer and other diseases. It is difficult to distinguish mutagens from non-mutagens using simple machine learning algorithms. This is because mutagens and non-mutagens often have very similar chemical structures.

We use feature extraction to identify features that are relevant to mutagenicity. These features are then used to train machine learning models that can distinguish mutagens from non-mutagens with high accuracy.

The dataset is a matrix representation of the chemical compounds. We find relevant mathematical properties of these matrices to capture a wide range of chemical properties that are relevant to mutagenicity.
